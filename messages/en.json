				"voiceToDocument": {
					"question": "How does voice-to-document work?",
					"answer": "Simply tap the record button and describe your project naturally. Our AI listens to your voice, extracts key details like client info, pricing, and scope of work, then generates a professional document. You can review and edit before sending."
				},
				"languages": {
					"question": "What languages are supported?",
					"answer": "Currently we support English and Spanish. You can speak in either language or even mix them - our AI understands both. The generated documents can be in your preferred language."
				},
				"security": {
					"question": "Is my data secure?",
					"answer": "Yes, absolutely. All data is encrypted in transit and at rest. We use bank-level security and never share your information with third parties. Your documents and client data are yours alone."
				},
				"clientSigning": {
					"question": "Can clients sign without downloading an app?",
					"answer": "Yes! When you send a contract, your client receives a link they can open in any browser. They can review the document and sign with their finger - no app download required."
				},
				"recurring": {
					"question": "How do recurring invoices work?",
					"answer": "Set up a schedule (weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly) and Mr.Blu automatically generates and sends invoices to your recurring clients. You can choose to review before sending or let it run automatically."
				},
				"customize": {
					"question": "Can I customize my documents?",
					"answer": "Absolutely. You can edit any document before sending, save custom templates, and add your business logo and signature. The AI-generated content is just a starting point - make it yours."
